# tetris
The base of this project is from the 15-112 Tetris homework guide: https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~112-f22/notes/notes-tetris/index.html.

On top of it, I revamped it with OOP, a scoreboard, a next piece preview, holding pieces, an outline for where the piece will be droppeed, and an AI that simulates all moves and chooses the best one based on a heuristic.

Currently, the heuristic is taken from https://codemyroad.wordpress.com/2013/04/14/tetris-ai-the-near-perfect-player/
